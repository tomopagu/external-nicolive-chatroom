# External Nicolive Chatroom

A meteor webapp that houses a chatroom & embed of a Nicolive stream.

### Still in progress

Mostly going to be used by the English community when no English chatroom exsists on Niconico itself.

Could have some other uses though!

## Install
1. Clone repo
2. Run `meteor reset && meteor` in the root.
3. Go to `/admin` in browser to set up your useraccount

## TODO
- Styling
- Songlist
- Post songs to chat
